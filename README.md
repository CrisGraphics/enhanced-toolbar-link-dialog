## How to use

After you've installed *Kirby Better Link* successfully, open a page of your choice and click the link toolbar button. Make sure the toolbar or the link button [isn't switched off](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/textarea#toolbar__disabling-the-toolbar).

After you clicked the link toolbar button, a modal window gets openend which consists two tabs:

The "*External Link*" tab is exactly what you've had before.

Where it gets interesting is the "*Internal Link*" tab. Within this tab you can:
